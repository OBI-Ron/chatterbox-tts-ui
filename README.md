# Chatterbox-TTS UI

Lightweight Gradio interfaces for **Chatterbox-TTS**, ranging from a simple “Lite” interface to more advanced narrator and studio workflows.  
This repository currently focuses on the **Lite edition**, designed to be clean, minimal, and easy for new users.

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a local Gradio user interface for **Chatterbox-TTS**.  
The Lite edition enhances the basic Chatterbox demo by adding:

- **Automatic text chunking** (handles long passages gracefully)
- **Audio concatenation** (chunks are stitched into a single waveform)
- **Optional dual-mono stereo export** (for easier use in DAWs like Audacity)
- A simple, user-friendly UI

This interface **does not modify** Chatterbox-TTS itself — it simply provides an improved front-end.
